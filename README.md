# Computer Architecture 1 - Assembly Language (MASM-32)

## Abstract
This repository contains some exercises from the Computer Architecture discipline to be performed in Assembly language.

## Goals
- **Functioning of programming languages**: Transformation of instructions in high-level to low-level language, managing memory and registers.
- **Optimizing performance**: Low-level languages ​​perform better than high-level languages, as they are closer to machine language.

## Tools
- **MASM-32**: Microsoft Macro Assembler (Masm32) toolkit for assembling and linking Assembly code on Intel processors.
