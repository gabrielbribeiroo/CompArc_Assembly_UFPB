# Final Project of the discipline Computer Architecture 1 - Assembly Language (MASM-32)

## Abstract
This folder contains the audio input and output files, which will be used to reduce the user's requested volume.

## Features
- **User interaction menu**: The user informs the audio input file, the output file, and the volume reduction constant.
- **Reduction loop**: After reducing the file's volume, the program asks if the user is interested in reducing the volume of another file.

## Goals
- **Functioning of programming languages**: Transforming instructions from high-level to low-level language, managing memory and registers.
- **Optimizing performance**: Low-level languages ​​perform better than high-level languages, as they are closer to machine language.
- **Audio reduction**: Using some Assembly functions, the program will return the output file with the volume limited on a scale of 1 to 10.

## Tools
- **MASM-32**: Microsoft Macro Assembler (Masm32) toolkit for assembling and linking Assembly code on Intel processors.
